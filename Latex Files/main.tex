    Below is an SIR model with births and deaths for infectious disease. $S(t)$ is the number of susceptible individuals, and $I(t)$ is the number of the infected individuals. It is assumed that susceptible individuals can produce an uninfected offspring with rate $b$, that they become infected when they come in contact with infected people at rate $\beta$, and that the infected individuals die at rate $k$. This is described by the following equations:
    
    \begin{align*}
        & \frac{dS}{dt} = bS - \beta IS \\
        & \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta IS - kI
    \end{align*}
    
\end{flushleft}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find all equilibriums and their stability.

    \item Solve $S$ in terms of a function in $I$ analytically (it is OK to leave a free constant). Are the orbits $(S(t); I(t)), t \geq 0$ periodic in the $S-I$ plane?
    
    \item Sketch several typical phase lines in $S-I$ plane.
    
    \item Solve the ODE system numerically with $b = \beta = k = 3$. Try initial conditions $S(0) = 1$ and $I(0)$ equal to either $0.1$, $0.5$ or $1.3$. Vary the time step size as $\Delta = 0.1$, $0.01$, $0.001$. Do you observe the convergence?
