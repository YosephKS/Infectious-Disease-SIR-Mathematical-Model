# Infectious-Disease-SIR-Mathematical-Model
Author: Yoseph Kurnia Soenggoro

This GitHub Repository represents an implementation of SIR Model using Python. All documenatation and reports are within the repository. The Resources in here are all open source. All the code are written within the Jupyter notebook `Python_Code.ipynb` in sequential order. If more details and explanation are neede, feel free to read the `.pdf` file. Furthermore, if you want to change the report's content, feel free to access the `.tex` files under the `Latex Files` folder.

### Cloning the Repository
In order to clone the repo, simply type the following in the terminal:

```console
  foo@bar:$ git clone https://github.com/YosephKS/Infectious-Disease-SIR-Mathematical-Model.git
```
### Python Libraries
If you want to use the python code within the jupyter notebook, make sure that you have downloaded `Python 3.7+` and have the necessary libraries within your virtual environment or your machine. To install `Python 3`, enter the following command:

```console
  foo@bar:$ brew install python
```

and to test whether the installation is successful, enter the following command

```console
  foo@bar:$ python --version
```
If the output is the `Python 3` version installed within your machine, then the installation is successful. Otherwise, further configuration will be essential. Next, if you haven't installed `matplotlib` and `jupyterlab`, then open your terminal/command prompt and type the following:

```console
  # Installing using Python Package Index
  foo@bar:$ pip install matplotlib
  foo@bar:$ pip install jupyterlab
```
OR
```console
  # Installing using Anaconda
  foor@bar:$ conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
  foor@bar:$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```
